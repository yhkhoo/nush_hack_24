## Inspiration
The current peer tutoring system is disjoint and inconvenient for both tutors and tutees. The tutors will also have to meet the tutees in person, which leads to numerous security concerns for both parties. Hence, we wanted to improve it and create a new system that is both easy to use and to ensure the safety of the tutors and tutees.
## What it does
It is a digital platform which allows for tutors and tutees to more conveniently, effectively and securely provide and receive tutoring services, for students interested in tutoring and receiving tutoring, by allowing potential tutees to find tutors tailored to them, and also communicate with each other in the app for a seamless and secure experience.
## How we built it
Using Jetpack Compose for the front-end and Google Firebase for the rear-end.
## Challenges we ran into
The database stopped working halfway through our development
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have successfully created an application with numerous features.
## What we learned
How to use the Google FIrebase API with the jetpack compose framework.
## What's next for tutr
The platform can be expanded to more areas such as leadership and soft skills.
After enough usage and testing for students, this can expand for adults to teach and learn professional skills.
Peer-to-peer tutoring does not stop at academics.
